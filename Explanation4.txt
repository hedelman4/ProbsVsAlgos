PROBLEM4: DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG PROBLEM

In order to sort an array with elements containing 0,1 or 2 in a single traversal, I either popped a zero and inserted it at the
beginning of the array, or popped a two and appended it to the end of the array. The space complexity would be O(C) based on the size 
of the array passed through the function.
