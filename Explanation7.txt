PROBLEM 7: HTTPROUTER USING A TRIE

I constructed the Trie by splitting a given path by the forward slashes in the path. Each of the split paths become nodes in the trie.
I also made the initial string object for the Router class a "default handler" name so that a single "/" character slash would associate
with the default handler name. 

Method 'Split Path':
Splitting a given path requires time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n*m) based on the number of path components
and the length of those components.


Method 'Add Handler':
Adding a handler takes O(n) time complexity. The space complexity would be O(n*m) based on the number of path components
and the length of those components.

Method 'Lookup':
Finding the route in a  Trie takes O(1) time complexity. The space complexity would be O(n*m) based on the number of path components
and the length of those components.
