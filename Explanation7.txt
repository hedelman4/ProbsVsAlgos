PROBLEM 7: HTTPROUTER USING A TRIE

I constructed the Trie by splitting a given path by the forward slashes in the path. Each of the split paths become nodes in the trie.
I also made the initial string object for the Router class a "default handler" name so that a single "/" character slash would associate
with the default handler name. 

Finding the route in a  Trie takes O(c) time comnplexity. The space complexity would be O(n*m) based on the number of path components
and the length of those components.
