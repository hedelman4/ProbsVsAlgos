PROBLEM 3: REARRANGE ARRAY ELEMENTS


In order to assign the largest elements of an array to the largest place value of two separate integers to be added, I used mergesort
to sort the array in time complexity O(nlog(n)). The space complexity is O(C), with the constant based on the size of the array being
passed through the function.
